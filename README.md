# Vrinda-Store-data-analysis
This is an end to end Excel Project.I worked on the Vrinda Store Data Analysis Project, where I handled the complete end-to-end workflow starting from data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accuracy, followed by data processing and exploratory analysis to uncover key sales patterns, customer demographics, and product performance. I then developed visualizations and dashboards to present the findings effectively and prepared a detailed report with insights and recommendations that could support data-driven decision-making and business growth.
